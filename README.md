Simple Slack-like chat app. Users can sign up, persistently login, create, delete and rename channels and add messages.

This app uses React for UI, Redux-JS-toolkit for state management, Axios and Soket.io to communicate with the server, JWT for authorization, i18next for internationalization, React-Bootstrap and React-toastify for styling.

Just clone this repository and run:
    make install
    make start
